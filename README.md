## Hacktoberfest
### What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:
- Prepare and share your project for collaboration
- Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
- Organize an event
- Mentor others
- Donate directly to open source projects

### How to Participate
As a participant, whether a beginner or experienced, you have an opportunity to learn about open source and contribute to open source projects. Open-source projects keep the internet humming—but they can’t do it without resources. Donate and support their awesome work.   

In order to participante, you need to sign in on the [Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) using your GitHub account. All the pull requests that you initiate will be tracked through this portal. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

Once registered, you need to contribute to open source projects which are participating in the fest. Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest. 

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

Participants with atleast 4 accepted pull requests will receive rewards from digitalocean. Rather than receive t-shirts as swag, you can choose to have a tree planted in your name and help make Hacktoberfest 2021 more carbon neutral. 

### Rules
- The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
